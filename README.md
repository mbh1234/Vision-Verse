# Vision-Verse

#### **Project Overview**  
"VISION VERSE" is a comprehensive image processing project designed to introduce fundamental techniques and tools in Python programming, image enhancement, and manipulation. Through weekly lectures, hands-on assignments, and a capstone project, mentees learn key image processing concepts such as edge detection, image segmentation, and filtering, which are crucial in applications like medical imaging and computer vision.

I was a mentor for this project involving 40 mentees.
